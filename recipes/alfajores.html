    <img class="image " src="../images/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="A bowl of alfajores">

    <p>These bite-sized snacks are filled with creamy dulce de leche and rolled in shredded coconut.</p>

    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 1/4 cups cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>3/4 cups unsalted butter. Softened.</li>
        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3 large eggs. Separate yolks and whites. We'll only be using the yolk.</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup dulce de leche</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsweetened shredded coconut</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><strong>Instructions</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, sift together flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and baking soda. Set aside for later.</li>
        <li>Fix a stand mixer with a paddle. Beat butter and sugar on medium until it is light and fluffy (approx. 3-minutes).</li>
        <li>Add in egg yolks and vanilla extract. Beat at low speed until the mixture is combined.</li>
        <li>Add flour mix that was set aside. Continue to beat at low speed until the mixture is combined. Do not over-mix or the dough will become tough.</li>
        <li>Form the dough into one large ball. Then flatten into a disk.</li>
        <li>Cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1-2 hours until the dough becomes firm. You can store the dough for up to 3-days or freeze for up to one month. Simply thaw in the refrigerator overnight.</li>
        <li>Remove the dough from the refrigerator and allow to warm for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough to between 1/8 and 1/4 inches.</li>
        <li>Cut the dough into 2-inch circles. Place the cuts onto baking sheets lined with parchment paper. You may re-roll dough scraps to make additional cookies.</li>
        <li>Place cookie sheets into the refrigerator for about 15-minutes or until the cookies are firm. This will reduce spreading.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Bake cookies for 7-10 minutes or until the cookies are golden brown along the edges.</li>
        <li>Allow the cookies to cool in the pan for 10-minutes before transferring to a wire rack.</li>
        <li>Add a small spoonful (approx. 1 tsp) of dulce de leche to half of the cookies. Cover with the other half and press until the dulce de leche bulges from the sides.</li>
        <li>Roll the sides of the cookies in coconut.</li>
        <li>Cookies can be stored at room temperature for up to a week or frozen for up to two months. To thaw, simply leave at room temperature for a few hours.</li>
    </ol>
